okay .. lets start with the implementation..
i have choosen 5 role based users : admin,nurse,patient, pharmacy , doctor....
Admin functionalities :
1.add departments ( cardiology,etc..)
2.add doctors,nurse,pharmacy guy .This means that admin will be registering these guys.While registering
 admin adds all their details and they will be provided with a registration form only to set their username and
 password . This credentials will then be used by them to login.
3.add pharmacy details.
Think of anything else that admin can do.

Patient functionalities:
Once he registers and logs in, he will be provided with a dashboard.Think of all the things that he might need.
One of the things that he needs is that he should be able to book appointment to the specific doctor and get
the token. 

Doctor functionalities:
There are 2 types of doctors:consultancy and surgeon.
For consultancy doctor:
Once the doctor logs in,he gets a dashboard.Again think of all the that he might need in there.
One of it is,he should be able to see who has appointment with him and once he consults them,
he should prescribe medicines and this prescription should then go to the pharamacy guys dashboard.

For surgeon:
same login process.Design his dashboard (consults first and then proceeds to operate)
.One of things to include in dashboard is operation schedule and operation theater schedule management.

Pharmacy guy functionalities:
drug inventory management (think of all the things that he might need to do),
 drug dispensing based on the prescription sent by the doctor,etc..
